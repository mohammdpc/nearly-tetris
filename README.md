you can control the game with the arrow keys, up rotates the pieces, down moves the piece down(they don't move on their own because I use getchar() function to read the input), left and right do as you would expect.
this is the first c project I made, just be aware of lines from 332 to 362, or just don't get a score below 20 :)
